#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1.  How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3.  Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON Feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE LENGTH(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4.  Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?

Select Product, MIN(price) as CheapestPrice
FROM JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY CheapestPrice
LIMIT 1;

#5.  What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?

SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderid) = 6
and orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;

#6.  Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?

SELECT SUM(Quantity),Product,SUM(quantity)*price as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
Where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;

#7.  How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers? 

SELECT COUNT(distinct cust.acctnum), avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.Febsales Feb
LEFT Join BIT_DB.customers cust
On Feb.orderID=cust.order_id
Where Feb.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#8.  List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold.

SELECT Product, Sum(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE location like '%Los Angeles%'
GROUP BY Product;

#9.  Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, 
#    and how many orders did they each receive? (Hint: use HAVING).

SELECT Distinct location, COUNT(orderID) AS orders_received
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE '%New York%'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID) >= 3;

#10.  How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT SUM(quantity) as quantity, Product
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Product like '%Headphone%'
GROUP BY Product;

#11.  What was the average amount spent per account in February? (Hints: For this question, 
#     we want the average amount spent / number of accounts, not the amount spent by each account. 
#     To multiply, you can use the * symbol, and to divide, you can use the / symbol.)

SELECT SUM(price * Quantity) / COUNT(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
ON cust.order_ID = Feb.orderid
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#12.  What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February? (Hint: just like question 11, 
#     we want the overall average, not the average for each account individually).

SELECT sum(Quantity) / Count(cust.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales feb
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust 
ON feb.orderID = cust.order_id
WHERE Length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#13.  Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT Product, SUM(Quantity * price) AS TotalRevenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product
ORDER BY TotalRevenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
