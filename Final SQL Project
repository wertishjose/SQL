JOIN chinook.invoices i ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.customers c ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId;

#8.  How many Invoices were there in 2009?

select Count(*) as '2009 Invoices'
from chinook.invoices
where InvoiceDate like '%2009%';

#9.  What are the total sales for 2009?

select SUM(Total) as 'Total Sales 2009'

#10.  Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID.

SELECT t.Name AS PurchasedTrackName, ii.InvoiceLineID
FROM chinook.invoice_items ii
JOIN chinook.tracks t ON ii.TrackId = t.TrackId;

#11.  Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name 
#     with each invoice line ID.

SELECT a.Name AS ArtistName, t.Name AS PurchasedTrackName, ii.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.invoice_items ii
LEFT JOIN chinook.tracks t ON ii.TrackId = t.TrackId
INNER JOIN chinook.albums al ON t.AlbumId = al.AlbumId
LEFT JOIN chinook.artists a ON al.ArtistId = a.ArtistId;

#12.  Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name,

SELECT t.Name as 'Track Name', a.Title as 'Album Name', m.Name as 'Media Type', 
g.Name as 'Genre'

JOIN chinook.genres g on g.GenreId = t.GenreId
JOIN chinook.albums a on t.AlbumId = a.AlbumId;

#13.  Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

SELECT e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS SalesAgentName, 
ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'

join chinook.invoices i on i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
GROUP BY SalesAgentName;

#14.  Which sales agent made the most dollars in sales in 2009?

SELECT e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName as 'Sales Agent Name', 
ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales'

WHERE e.Title like 'Sales%Agent'
AND i.InvoiceDate like '2009%'
Group by e.Firstname
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(i.Total), 2) desc limit 1;
